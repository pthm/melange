## What is Melange?

Melange takes a different approach to authorization. Instead of running graph traversal in application code, Melange:

- **Precomputes authorization rules at migration time** - OpenFGA schemas are parsed and flattened into PostgreSQL tables
- **Executes permission checks in SQL** - Runtime queries leverage precomputed data with no application-level graph traversal
- **Uses views for tuple storage** - Permissions derive from a `melange_tuples` view over your existing tables

## Initial Features

- Core schema parsing and model generation
- Basic permission checking infrastructure
- PostgreSQL function-based authorization checks
