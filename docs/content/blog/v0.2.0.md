## Highlights

### OpenFGA Test Suite Integration

Melange now runs against the official OpenFGA test suite, ensuring compatibility with the specification.

### Comprehensive Pattern Support

Support for the majority of OpenFGA authorization patterns:

- **Intersection (AND) rules** - `define viewer: writer and editor`
- **Exclusion rules** - `define viewer: writer but not blocked`
- **Userset references** - `define viewer: [group#member]`
- **Computed usersets** - `define viewer: owner`
- **Tuple-to-userset patterns** - `define viewer: viewer from parent`
- **Wildcards** - `define public: [user:*]`
- **Contextual tuples** - Temporary tuples passed with check requests

### Performance Optimizations

- **Relation closure table** - Precomputes implied-by relationships for efficient resolution
- **Userset rules table** - Precomputes userset expansions at migration time
- **Recursive CTEs** - Rewrote list operations for 10-50x performance gains

### List Functions

- `list_accessible_objects` - Find all objects a subject can access
- `list_users` - Find all subjects with access to an object

### Schema Validation

- Cycle detection catches invalid schemas early
- OpenFGA-compatible error semantics for invalid requests
