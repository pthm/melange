## Highlights

This release represents a fundamental architectural shift: Melange now generates specialized SQL functions for each relation in your authorization model, eliminating generic runtime functions entirely.

### Fully Generated SQL Functions

Instead of storing model data in PostgreSQL tables and using generic functions at runtime, Melange now:

1. **Analyzes your schema** at migration time to understand each relation's features
2. **Generates specialized check functions** tailored to each relation's specific patterns
3. **Creates a dispatcher function** that routes permission checks to the appropriate specialized function

This eliminates runtime table lookups and produces SQL optimized for each authorization pattern.

### List Function Code Generation

Complete code generation support for list operations across all pattern types, achieving 100% coverage across the OpenFGA test suite:

- Direct assignment and implied relations
- Exclusion patterns
- Userset patterns
- Recursive tuple-to-userset patterns
- Intersection patterns
- Indirect anchor patterns for complex userset chains

### Additional Improvements

- **No-wildcard variants** - Optimized functions for relations that don't use wildcards
- **Migration tracking** - Dry-run mode and version tracking
- **Removed runtime tables** - All logic is now embedded in generated SQL functions
