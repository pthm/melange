## What's Next

This is the final pre-release. The next version will be **v1.0.0**, marking the first stable release of Melange.

## Highlights

### Language-Agnostic Restructuring

Major reorganization to support multiple target languages:

- **Go runtime extracted** into a dedicated `melange/` module with minimal dependencies
- **Tooling split** into `pkg/` (public API) and `internal/` (implementation details)
- **Schema package** moved into tooling as a subpackage

This separation keeps the runtime lightweight while allowing the tooling to support code generation for any language.

### Multi-Language Client Generation

New `generate client` CLI subcommand with a pluggable generator registry. This enables generating type-safe authorization clients from your schema for multiple target languages.

### Go-Driven SQL Generation

Refactored SQL generation from text templates to a Go-driven DSL approach. The new `sqlgen` package builds SQL programmatically with typed column references and a feature-driven builder pattern, improving maintainability and correctness.

### Doctor Command

New `doctor` CLI command for health checks on your authorization infrastructure.

### Other Improvements

- Fixed exclusion handling for wildcard and complex closure relations
- GitHub Actions test pipeline
- Expanded documentation
