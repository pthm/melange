Learn how to use Melange's client libraries and SQL functions for authorization in your application. These guides cover practical usage patterns for checking individual permissions and listing accessible resources - the core operations you'll use to integrate fine-grained authorization into your services.

Each guide includes examples in multiple languages. For direct SQL usage from any language, see the [SQL API reference](../reference/sql-api).
